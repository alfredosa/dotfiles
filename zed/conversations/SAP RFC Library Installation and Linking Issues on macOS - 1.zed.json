The Go compiler is using object files built for a newer macOS version (14.0) than the version it's trying to link against (11.0). This is causing warnings but shouldn't prevent the program from running.\n\n2. The main problem is that the dynamic linker (dyld) can't find the `libsapnwrfc.dylib` library at runtime.\n\nTo resolve this, try the following steps:\n\n1. Ensure that the SAP NWRFC SDK is correctly installed in `/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk`.\n\n2. Set the `SAPNWRFC_HOME` environment variable:\n   ```\n   export SAPNWRFC_HOME=/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk\n   ```\n\n3. Add the SDK's lib directory to your `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`:\n   ```\n   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n4. Run the `paths_fix.sh` script as mentioned in the instructions:\n   ```\n   $SAPNWRFC_HOME/paths_fix.sh\n   ```\n\n5. Make sure your Go code is setting the correct library path. You might need to add something like this at the beginning of your Go file:\n   ```go\n   package main\n\n   /*\n   #cgo CFLAGS: -I${SAPNWRFC_HOME}/include\n   #cgo LDFLAGS: -L${SAPNWRFC_HOME}/lib -lsapnwrfc\n   */\n   import \"C\"\n   ```\n\n6. Rebuild and run your Go program:\n   ```\n   go build -o hello_gorfc hello_gorfc.go\n   ./hello_gorfc\n   ```\n\nIf you're still having issues, you might need to explicitly copy `libsapnwrfc.dylib` to a location in your system's library path or to the same directory as your executable.\n\nAlso, ensure that you're using a version of the SAP NWRFC SDK that's compatible with your macOS version and Go installation.\n\nIf the problem persists, you may need to contact SAP support or consult the SAP NWRFC SDK documentation for macOS-specific installation instructions.\nInteresting error: “libsapnwrfc.dylib” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.\n\nThis software needs to be updated. Contact the developer for more information.\n\nMicrosoft Teams WebView created this file today at 18:25.\nThis error is related to macOS security features, specifically Gatekeeper and notarization. Here's what's happening and how you can address it:\n\n1. Apple's Gatekeeper is blocking the library because it's not notarized or signed by an identified developer.\n\n2. This is a common issue with third-party libraries, especially those distributed by enterprise software vendors like SAP.\n\nTo resolve this, you have a few options:\n\n1. Temporarily bypass Gatekeeper (not recommended for regular use):\n   - Right-click (or Control-click) on the libsapnwrfc.dylib file.\n   - Choose \"Open\" from the context menu.\n   - In the dialog that appears, click \"Open\" again.\n   - This should allow the file to run and may prevent future warnings.\n\n2. Use Terminal to remove the quarantine attribute:\n   - Open Terminal\n   - Navigate to the directory containing libsapnwrfc.dylib\n   - Run: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine libsapnwrfc.dylib`\n\n3. Adjust Security & Privacy settings:\n   - Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General\n   - You might see a message about libsapnwrfc.dylib being blocked\n   - Click \"Allow Anyway\" if that option is available\n\n4. Contact SAP support:\n   - Inform them about this issue\n   - They might provide an updated, notarized version of the library\n\n5. If you're in an enterprise environment:\n   - Your IT department might have tools to manage these security settings across the organization\n\nRemember, bypassing security features can potentially expose your system to risks. It's always best to use properly signed and notarized software when possible.\n\nAfter applying one of these solutions, try running your Go program again. If you're still having issues, you might need to restart your terminal or even your computer for the changes to take effect.\ndyld[84071]: Library not loaded: @loader_path/libsapnwrfc.dylib\n  Referenced from: <3023AC41-FBE3-7DED-F1C9-976CBA58BE1E> /private/var/folders/yl/ytx0nyg15h30qpqpswb8m2_r0000gn/T/go-build2098633235/b001/exe/hello_gorfc\n  Reason: tried: '/private/var/folders/yl/ytx0nyg15h30qpqpswb8m2_r0000gn/T/go-build2098633235/b001/exe/libsapnwrfc.dylib' (no such file)\nsignal: abort trap\nThis error indicates that the dynamic linker (dyld) is still unable to find the `libsapnwrfc.dylib` library at runtime. The loader is looking for the library in the same directory as your executable, which is a temporary directory created by Go during the build process.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to ensure that the library is either in the correct location or that the loader knows where to find it. Here are some steps to try:\n\n1. Copy the library to the executable's directory:\n   This is a quick fix, but not ideal for long-term use.\n   ```\n   cp $SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib/libsapnwrfc.dylib .\n   ```\n\n2. Use install_name_tool to change the library path:\n   ```\n   install_name_tool -change @loader_path/libsapnwrfc.dylib $SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib/libsapnwrfc.dylib hello_gorfc\n   ```\n\n3. Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:\n   ```\n   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n4. Use -rpath in your Go build command:\n   ```\n   go build -ldflags \"-r $SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib\" -o hello_gorfc hello_gorfc.go\n   ```\n\n5. Modify your Go code to include the correct rpath:\n   Add this to the top of your Go file:\n   ```go\n   /*\n   #cgo CFLAGS: -I${SAPNWRFC_HOME}/include\n   #cgo LDFLAGS: -L${SAPNWRFC_HOME}/lib -lsapnwrfc -Wl,-rpath,${SAPNWRFC_HOME}/lib\n   */\n   import \"C\"\n   ```\n\n6. Check if the library is actually in the expected location:\n   ```\n   ls -l $SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib/libsapnwrfc.dylib\n   ```\n\n7. Verify that the library is compatible with your system:\n   ```\n   file $SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib/libsapnwrfc.dylib\n   ```\n\n8. Check for any dynamic link dependencies:\n   ```\n   otool -L $SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib/libsapnwrfc.dylib\n   ```\n\nAfter trying these steps, rebuild your program and run it again. If you're still having issues, you might need to contact SAP support for a version of the library that's compatible with your specific macOS version and architecture.\n\nRemember to run `go clean -cache` between attempts to ensure you're not using cached build artifacts.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":152}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":10},"start":56,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":153}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":2279,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":154}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":3024,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":155}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":4748,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":156}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":102},"start":5002,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":157}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":103},"start":6775,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":158}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":133},"start":7150,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":159}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":134},"start":9110,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":160}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"SAP RFC Library Installation and Linking Issues on macOS","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
