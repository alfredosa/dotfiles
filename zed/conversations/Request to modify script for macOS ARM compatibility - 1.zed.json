{"id":"ce4a5239-682b-4348-bd4e-62fea5fd1b22","zed":"context","version":"0.4.0","text":"\n\n\nlets fix this script. But first of all, what we have currently should only execute on macos arm architecture :D \nCertainly! I'd be happy to help you modify the script to only execute on macOS with ARM architecture. Could you please share the current script you have? That way, I can see what we're working with and make the necessary adjustments to ensure it only runs on macOS ARM systems.\n\nOnce you provide the script, we can:\n\n1. Add a check for the operating system (macOS)\n2. Add a check for the ARM architecture\n3. Modify any existing code to fit these requirements\n4. Add error messages or exit conditions for non-macOS or non-ARM systems\n\nPlease share your current script, and I'll help you make the required changes.\n```sh Scripts/install_macos_gorfc_deps.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nGORFC_PATH=/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk\n\nmkdir $GORFC_PATH\ncp -r ../macos-gorfc $GORFC_PATH\n\ncd $GORFC_PATH\nsudo chmox +x install.sh\n\necho \"\"\"\ngotta add this to your preferred rc -> .bashrc / .zshrc (this is cool)\nexport SAPNWRFC_HOME=\"$GORFC_PATH\"\nexport CGO_CFLAGS=\"-I $SAPNWRFC_HOME/include\"\nexport CGO_LDFLAGS=\"-L $SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib\"\nexport CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW=.*\nexport CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW=.*\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nThank you for sharing the script. Let's modify it to ensure it only runs on macOS with ARM architecture. Here's the updated script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if running on macOS\nif [[ \"$(uname)\" != \"Darwin\" ]]; then\n    echo \"This script is intended to run only on macOS.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Check if running on ARM architecture\nif [[ \"$(uname -m)\" != \"arm64\" ]]; then\n    echo \"This script is intended to run only on ARM architecture.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nGORFC_PATH=/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk\n\n# Check if the directory already exists\nif [ -d \"$GORFC_PATH\" ]; then\n    echo \"The directory $GORFC_PATH already exists. Please remove it before running this script.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nmkdir -p $GORFC_PATH\ncp -r ../macos-gorfc $GORFC_PATH\n\ncd $GORFC_PATH\nif [ -f \"install.sh\" ]; then\n    sudo chmod +x install.sh\nelse\n    echo \"install.sh not found in $GORFC_PATH\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"\"\"\nPlease add the following to your preferred rc file (.bashrc / .zshrc):\n\nexport SAPNWRFC_HOME=\\\"$GORFC_PATH\\\"\nexport CGO_CFLAGS=\\\"-I \\$SAPNWRFC_HOME/include\\\"\nexport CGO_LDFLAGS=\\\"-L \\$SAPNWRFC_HOME/lib\\\"\nexport CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW=.*\nexport CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW=.*\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nChanges made:\n\n1. Added checks for macOS and ARM architecture at the beginning of the script.\n2. Added error handling for when the target directory already exists.\n3. Fixed a typo in the `chmod` command (changed `chmox` to `chmod`).\n4. Added a check to ensure `install.sh` exists before attempting to change its permissions.\n5. Improved the formatting of the echo statement at the end for better readability.\n\nThis script will now only run on macOS systems with ARM architecture. It will exit with an error message if run on any other system or architecture.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":59}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":14},"start":116,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":60}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":729,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":61}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":51},"start":1181,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":62}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":52},"start":2885,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":63}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Request to modify script for macOS ARM compatibility","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"},{"range":{"start":729,"end":1179},"icon":"File","label":"Scripts/install_macos_gorfc_deps.sh"}]}
