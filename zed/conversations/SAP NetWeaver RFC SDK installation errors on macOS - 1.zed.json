These errors suggest that the script is unable to find the necessary files and directories. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. Ensure SAPNWRFC_HOME is set correctly:\n   Make sure the SAPNWRFC_HOME environment variable is set and points to the correct directory where the SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK is installed.\n\n   You can set it like this:\n   ```\n   export SAPNWRFC_HOME=/path/to/your/sapnwrfc/sdk\n   ```\n\n2. Check the directory structure:\n   Ensure that the SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK is properly extracted and has the expected directory structure, including 'lib' and 'bin' folders.\n\n3. Run the script from the correct directory:\n   Make sure you're running the script from the directory that contains the 'lib' and 'bin' folders, not from inside one of these folders.\n\n4. Check file permissions:\n   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and modify the files in the SDK directory.\n\n5. Verify SDK version compatibility:\n   Make sure the script is compatible with your version of the SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK. The script seems to be looking for specific file names and versions (e.g., libicui18n.50.dylib), which might not match your SDK version.\n\n6. Install Command Line Tools:\n   Ensure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed, as the script is using tools like install_name_tool.\n\n7. Check for missing dependencies:\n   The errors suggest some libraries are missing. Make sure all required libraries are present in the 'lib' folder.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, you might need to:\n- Review and possibly modify the script to match your SDK version and directory structure.\n- Contact SAP support or consult SAP-specific forums for more targeted assistance with the NetWeaver RFC SDK installation process on macOS.\n\nRemember to back up your files before making any changes, and proceed with caution when modifying system files or SDK components.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":28}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3},"start":14,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":29}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":4},"start":15,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":30}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":3543,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":31}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":5561,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":32}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK installation errors on macOS","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
